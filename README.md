## Personal Website 2.0 

Used React, Gatsby, and Contentful to create my personal landing page at https://lilianwzhou.com/ 

I set it up so that adding new information to my website is easy and I only need to add it in Contentful. I set up hooks so that Netlify redeploys whenever I publish contentful changes or pushes to main.
